# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient medical data and Machine Learning. It follows a complete ML pipeline including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction. The Random Forest Classifier was selected as the final model based on its performance.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a patient has heart disease using clinical and medical attributes.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset:** UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Records:** 303 Patients
- **Target Variable:** `num` (converted into binary target)
  - **0** → No Heart Disease
  - **1** → Heart Disease

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
